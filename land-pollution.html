<h1>Land Pollution</h1>

<p>Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth’s land surfaces, at and below ground level. The cause is the accumulation of solid and liquid waste materials that contaminate groundwater and soil. These waste materials are often referred to as municipal solid waste (MSW), which includes both hazardous and non-hazardous waste.</p>

<p>
When waste is deposited onto an area of land, the permeability of the soil formations below the waste can increase or reduce the risk of land pollution. The higher the permeability of the soil, the more likely that land pollution will occur. That’s why the Texas Disposal Systems Landfill, located just outside of Austin, Texas, was built in an ideal area. By utilizing the natural shale and clay in the land, the risk of land pollution has been significantly decreased. The TDS Austin landfill combines natural and manmade barriers to meet stringent environmental protection regulations. The landfill structure features a performance-based liner system with a leachate collection system and thick re-compacted clay sidewall liners. The liner system easily meets the standards of the performance-based landfill liner system currently required by both the EPA and the TCEQ. </p>


<h2>Effects of Land Pollution</h2>
<p>
Land pollution touches essentially every area of the living world, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Water that isn’t safe to drink
</li>

<li>
Polluted soil, which leads to a loss of fertile land for agriculture
</li>
<li>
Climate change, which causes an onslaught of disastrous problems, including flash floods and irregular rainfalls 
</li>

<li>
The endangerment and extinction of species in wildlife
Habitat shifting, where some animals are forced to flee where they live in order to survive
</li>

<li>
An increase in wildfires, due to polluted areas often becoming very dry
<li>

<li>
Increased air pollution, which burning waste contributes to</li>

<li>
Increased soil pollutants can enter the body through the food chain, and cause health issues
</li>

</ul>
<h3>It's Preventing:</h3>
<li>
One can reuse products like fabric, plastic bags, and glass in your home rather than throwing them away to minimize solid waste emissions on soil. Recycling helps to minimize the amount of solid waste that ends up in landfills while also helping to save natural resources.
